# Universal Counting Function
## A Mathematical Revolution in Simplicity

## About

The Universal Counting Function (UCF) is a simple yet powerful mathematical concept that provides a universal method for counting by any integer n. This repository contains implementations in Python, JavaScript, and C++.

## Mathematical Formulation

The UCF is described by the equation 
Tᵢ = in, where Tᵢ is the i-th term in the sequence, i is an index in Z⁺, and n is any integer.

## Getting Started

### Python
Run the UCF_Python.py file to see the UCF in action for Python.

### JavaScript
Open UCF_Javascript.html in a web browser and open the console to see the UCF results.

### C++
Compile and run the UCF_CPP.cpp file to see the UCF results in C++.
